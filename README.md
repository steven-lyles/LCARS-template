# LCARS Template
**L**ibrary **C**omputer **A**ccess and **R**etrival **S**ystem is the fictional OS that was invented as a visual prop for 
Star Trek TNG. This project is creating a very modular implementation for a webpage or app. This is still very much a work 
in progress. Currently this code is an HTML/Javascript client side implementation only, but I am working on a server side 
implementation using Ruby and Sinatra... stay tuned!

This project was greatly inspired by the work of Jim Robertus and his [LCARS Website Template](https://www.thelcars.com). My version has 
evolved to an entirely different implementation, but I want to give Jim credit for his incredible work and credit for his 
amazing color palettes of which I borrowed a few... thanks Jim!

This project is designed to work in tandem with the [web-widgets](https://github.com/steven-lyles/web-widgets) project which will create elements of the interface.

The page consists of a main flex column container consisting of a header, content and footer. Each of these containers is 
further populated with flex containers that are populated with various widgets or content. All parts, including the widgets, 
are generated from JSON configurations. This includes any CSS.

This project is a work in progress, but you can view a live demo of the latest progress at:
